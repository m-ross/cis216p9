This program prompts the user for the name of a file containing a customer's information, including the name of a file containing information on their transactions. The program will not proceed until a proper customer file is found. The program ends early only if the user closes the file name prompt, the transaction file has unexpected data, it is not found, or if updating either file is unsuccessful.
